To explain various steps in ML project. We will use "Real estate price prediction" data set . The Kaggle link for the data set

 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quantbruce/real-estate-price-prediction

This dataset has 414 sample data . We will create a ML model to predict the price per unit area of a house based on -

1.   Age of the house
2.   Distance from nearest MRT satiation
3.   Number of convenience stores

STEP 1 - Data Collection
We will used python panda library to load data (collected from Kaggle)</font>
"""

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("../core/Real_estate.csv")

"""
STEP 2 - Data Cleaning 

Logically Columns like -
1.   transaction date
2.   latitude
3.   longitude

Should not have any influence on the outcome (price per unit). Hence, we should remove them </font>

STEP 3 - Data Preparation

In this step we will select input and result data and create train and test data sample.
In current example we will consider

input x -> age of the house,
distance from nearest MRT satiation,
number of convenience stores</font>
output y ->house price per unit area

STEP 4 - Model Selection

Process of fitting the dataset into a standard ML model algorithm . Our current dataset is best fit for Linear Regression algorithm. We will use standard Python sklearn "LinearRegression" ML model algorithm

STEP 5 - Model Training
We will used standard library method to train our model with train data set created in step-3</font>

STEP 6 - Model Evaluation
We will used sample test data created in step-3 to evaluate the model performance. Model's standard methods will be used.

Depending on the use-case and type of the model selection various performance matrices will be collected to evaluate the accuracy of the model. (standard libraried will be used)
